**TODO**
- The size of canvas is not adjusted in Opera upon switching to fullscreen and back. As a workaround press F11 and then reload the page by pressing F5. If you switch to fullscreen by clicking the icon in the upper right corner and press F5 afterwards, Opera switches back to non-fullscreen view.
- Animate bonus being added to score on game over
- Normalize sounds
