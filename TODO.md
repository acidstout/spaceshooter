**TODO**
- The size of canvas is not adjusted in Opera upon switching to fullscreen and back.
- Adjust difficulty. Currently the game is way too easy.
- Clean up variables (e.g. properly reset variables to initial values)
- Animate bonus being added to score on game over
- Change "LEFT: 1234567890" into "OVERKILL" in level 5 and only spawn huge motherships and lots of asteroids
